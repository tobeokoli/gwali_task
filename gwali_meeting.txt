Only use direct marketing when you need to, but mainly we need to make people believe in the brand.
Define and design the brand

Branding will allow you to be able to do so many things 

Do work for people that it matters for them
A brand is something that everyone knows your company for

Its okay for prople to think youre an idiot

Data
you have to do things for your customers so that they can know your brand. The idea of your brand is initiated by you, but it is other
people that push your brand for you.

You have now built a software that solves your needs. You have to convince the people that you built the software for that this is the 
solution to a problem that you both share


We seek to make change

Dont just chase a crowd, instead...do it for the people that need you to do it for them
connect deeply with the people that you built the solution for.

Build your brand by strictly focusing on identifing who exactly your users are and the kind of things that they like and using that information
to market the product to them

Some branding and marketing companies know how to get to the big billboards and get you in interviews and all of that, but is that really
what you want to achieve for your company...will you not prefer that the real people that you built the software for are actually the ones
that are using the software regularly....thanking you, loving you and promoting your app for you

who is the software for and what is it for


BE CONSISTENT!!! Dont do what your company does no need

We want to be on the right side of history. Be a brand marketer

We are marketing the brand and also marketing the software. How does the brand market the software built??

Be obsessed with some people, and make them so happy to hear from you that they want to call you, talk to you and they love to hear from you.

Be a craftsman. create scarcity and create value
