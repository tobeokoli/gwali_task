Clerkship in hospitals should be conducted in such a way that the student is trained to achieve the following outcomes:
o patients receive the maximum benefit from drug therapy.
o effective drug management of sub-acute care of patients in hospitals including
post-myocardial infarction, trauma, post-surgical, asthma exacerbation, oncology, and end-of-life care.
o appropriate selection of drugs and monitoring of drug therapy.
o cost-containment initiatives in patient care.
o pharmaceutical care provision in multiple-practice environments.
o educational services on drug-related issues to other health care practitioners,
pharmacy students and residents, patients and the community.
o drug information services to clinicians, patients and the community.
o play key roles in the development of disease specific drug-treatment guidelines.
Areas where students will be posted to will include psychiatry and community pharmacy practice.
