Marketing:
- 2 customer bases
- property target who you are marketing for
- before marketing for downloads we have to market for creators
- we need swags for moving around
- indicate that we are the best, reliable and cool in our catch phrases, posters and fliers
- if you infuse branding into marketing well enough, gwalinotes will be a household name in UNN
- we need to always address the public as gwalians and give them an identity
- we need a shit ton of posters, fliers etc
- we need to find the best plugs for marketing things in UNN
- we need to dedicate a length of time to publicizing posters and fliers...getting a group of people to move around school for a number of days
and ensure that they paste posters and share fliers in every important place in UNN campus
- unn facebook groups, unn whatsapp tvs, unn whatsapp chat groups, class groups, telegram, twitter, instagram
- incorporating the concept of "gwali understands me" into our posters, fliers, catch phrases, swags.
- comedy skits for gwalinotes
- UNN whatsapp tvs and  ig posts

Marketing ideas:
- we should create actual gwali notes and writing materials as swags and for sale
- first year student starter packs
- gwalian stickers
- give chitis and 1145 and other resturants 100 copies of our fliers so that people can pick them and share
- advertise in church bulletins and in big shows and in UNN Lion FM.

How to cut cost in our marketing:
- friends and family will assist us in posting gwali posters, and sharing fliers and evangelism and we will gift them with swags
- meet students that do all these branding things and try to get the best prices from them instead of using branding companies.
- bros abeg
- cost heavy points should be detected and then we should find the cheapest way to go about them
